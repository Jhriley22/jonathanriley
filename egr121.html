								<p>Through design challenges held throughout the semester, this class required me to work in teams to conceptualize, prototype, and design multiple products. In doing this I learned how to use computer software such as Solidworks while also developing many other hands on technical skills. </p>

								<p>For our first design challenge we worked on rapidly building a tower using a deck of cards and tape, to make them as tall as possible.</p>
								<b>Desgin Challenge 2: Machine Anatomy</b>
								<p>For our second design challenge we worked on disassembling a clock, and through this disassembly we learned how to create a bill of materials along with creating a structured assembly and exploded assembly of our clock.</p>
								<b>Design Challenge 3: Mech Machines</b>
								<p>For our third design challenge we worked on creating a nuclear warhead disarmament system, where we would have a balloon be popped within a glass chamber.</p>
								<b>Design Challenge 4: Happy Meals</b>
								<p>For our fourth design challenge we worked on designing a happy meal toy that was safe for children to use while also being appealing to parents of children.</p>
								<b>Design Challenge 5: Play Ball!</b>
								<p>For our fifth design challenge we worked on creating a Rube Goldberg Machine with multiple electronic componenets, arduino components and circuit boards, which would allow for a golf ball to travel throughout the course smoothly</p>
