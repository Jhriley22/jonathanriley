								<p>What did I do, what did I learn</p>
								<b>Design Challenge 5: Play Ball!</b>
								<p>The final design challenge consisted of building a Rube Goldberg machine which would transport a golf ball through multiple passes without any physical intervention once the ball is released. Although each group for this challenge had about twelve students, these groups were split into four subgroups of about three students each. Each subgroup needed to create two passes for the golf ball, each of which involving a circuit component, and one involving an Arduino component. My group decided to make a Mario themed machine, with each subgroup focusing on a different Mario world. Within our subgroup, we chose to cover the desert world (World 2), for our two passes.  Our first pass used a photoelectric sensor which released a solenoid that tossed up sand, while also creating a light display inside the pyramid, and our second pass used a switch which released an electromagnet that propelled the ball forward. When building our passes, we also had to coordinate with the teams directly before and after our passes to make sure that our components would connect properly so the ball would not stall. We had to combine all of the machining skills and circuitry skills we had obtained in our previous design challenges for this final project. When testing our completed machine, each of my subgroupâ€™s passes were functional and performed multiple times during the final testing.</p>

								<b>In Summary:</b>
								<p>This engineering class has allowed for me to begin exploring what life is like to bring ideas into reality. I have become competent using machines and software which I previously had never heard of such as a Tormac, Lathe, and Solidworks while I also improved my skill in using machines like the water jet and laser cutter. I learned about ideation processes such as character maps, how-why charts, and drawing in perspective.  I gained experience working in teams on project-based work and communicating with team members so that all objectives are met before our deadlines. Overall, I have really enjoyed this class, and I would love to give a big thank you to <a href="https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/rebecca-simmons">Dr. Rebecca Simmons</a> for teaching me this semester because her class has helped me grow as a student, and as a person.</p>
